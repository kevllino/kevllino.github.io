I am Kevin, originally from Paris. Developped a passion for all the "Data" dau ecosystem, Machine Leanring, Big Data technologies, functional programming. I enjoy coding in Python and Scala and love to write some SQL from time to time. During my free time I try to stay fit mainly by going to the gym. And a final word LOTR!
