I am Kevin, originally from Paris. Developped a passion for all the "Data" dau ecosystem, Machine Learning, Big Data technologies, functional programming. I enjoy coding in Python and Scala and don't dislike to write some SQL from time to time. During my free time I try to maintain a healthy way of living mainly by nutrition and sport. And a final word LOTR!
