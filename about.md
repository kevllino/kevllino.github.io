I am Kevin, originally from Paris. I hold 2 masters: M.Sc. in Information Systems and M.Sc. in Data Analytics. I developed a passion for all the data related subjects: Machine Learning, Big Data technologies, functional programming... I enjoy coding in Python and Scala, and I don't dislike to write some SQL from time to time. During my free time, I try to maintain a healthy way of living, mainly by nutrition and sport.
