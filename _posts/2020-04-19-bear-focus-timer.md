The [bear focus timer](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bft-bear-focus-timer/id1328806990) is a timer which enables you to apply the [Pomodoro technique](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730)
effortlessly and in an amusing way. I had to share this application as it allowed me to boost my productivity and focus. 

You know from books like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0349411905/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0349411905&linkCode=as2&tag=europatech-21&linkId=d637ca18830f9d06fe2f016d496c678d">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a><img src="//ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=europatech-21&l=am2&o=2&a=0349411905" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> 
that being able to focus without any disruptions is tantamount to conducting any real work in this world. Using the Pomodoro technique allows you to divide your time in short sessions of 25 minutes for example, and to only dedicate yourself to one task during that session. For instance, you could decide to use one Pomo session to write a blog post or 2 sessions to do an online tutorial. 

Applying this method can be challenging as nowadays, there are so many distractions, like checking your phone every minute. 
Thanks to the Bear Focus Timer (or BFT for the aficionados), I was able to achieve 8 sessions per day as a starter. 
The real power behind this application is that for the timer to start, you need to turn over your phone so you can't see its screen and the constant flow 
of notifications popping up on your phone. If you do check your phone during a session, however, the timer stops and you'll piss off the bear:

So you don't want to piss him off. Also, there are several settings to choose from, e.g. the white noise that the app plays to help you focus, 
the duration of your session, the break time duration or the number of sessions you want to do per day:

Mindless to say that for 2Â£ in the UK market, this application is a great tool to be more serious in applying the Pomodoro technique and therefore to boosting your focus and productivity.
Also, at the end of the session, you make the bear happy:
