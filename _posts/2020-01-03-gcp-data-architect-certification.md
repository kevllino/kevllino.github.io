This post will be very short as you can find more details <br>
in my previous post related to the GCP Data Engineer certification.

## Tips to pass with flying colors
Basically, after studying for the Data Engineer certification, it was way easier to take the architect exam, there are couple of differences though: 

- It's important to study before hand the case studies as you'll be more efficient at answering those questions during the exam, the DE one didn't have these type of questions 
- Studying for the DE certification covers a lot of knowledge that are present in the architect exam, i.e. BigData. 
- For the architect one, you'll need a more general and wider knowledge about using the GCP infrastructure. Some networking and security questions will be present in the exam, though, you don't 
need to study in-depth these topics
- I can't recommend enough the study materials from the [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/course/google-cloud-certified-professional-cloud-architect/), I studied with the Coursera one too, but the former is enough. 

## Conclusion
As with other exams, you only need to put the time and focus to be sure to succeed, take your time to study (if you need), but not too much, I usually book the exam date and then start preparing and this 
makes it compulsory for me not to procrastinate. In the end, it's worth taking the certification as it'll give you a overview of what services Google offer, moreover you'll get some swags ;).
