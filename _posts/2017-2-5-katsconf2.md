This blog post was written for [Kats Conf](http://www.katsconf.com/) as a lightning talk and exposes how to build flexible data pipelines by leveraging the AWS stack and the Serverless framework.

## Context 

At Nitro, our main software Nitro PDF, generates billions of user events. In fact, everytime that a user view, edit, share or sign a PDF document, an event is generated. And you are going to ask me:  

> kevllino! Why are we capturing some nuch data?! What is the point of all that, maybe to contribute to the hype of Big Data?

And to that I will answer: 

> Data alone is not relevant, we in fact, need to trasnform, manipulate it to be able to do something relevant with it!

Hence, the goal was to build sessions out of those events. This data engineering project is the basis to any future Machine Learning task on customer behaviour. Knowing how the user makes use of our software will drive predictive user behavior and will allow us to improve user experience. FIY a session in our context is defined as: 

- unique per machine 
- a session can be created by timeout given a specific threshold between 2 consecutive events. 
- a session can be created by an opening event

## Technology stack 

### Overview of the pipeline 

In this post, we conly cover the non-grey component of the follwoing infrastructure:

In order to sessionize events, there are straightforward main steps to follow: 

1. Ingest the events in the pipeline

2. Filter our invalid events and process valid events. In this context, the processing includes a technical cleaning (fixing some erroneous value fields for some builds) and enriching the event schema, e.g. by deriving a timestamp into date and creating new features from existing ones. 

3. Create the sessions by tagging events with a uuid

### AWS for implementation 

In order to implement the business logic of those steps, we used **AWS Lambda** in Python. To transfer the data across the pipeline, we used Kinesis components, **Kinesis Streams** are used to move data between Lambdas and **Kinesis Firehose** to deliver dataa to an S3 bucket through a _delivery stream_. Lambda is great in that, you don't have to manage the back-end og your applicaiton and you only pay for the compute time, i.e. every time your Lambda code gets triggered by external events such as events coming from a stream.(https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/faqs/). Besides using Lambda for processing events, it also serves as a bridge to connect different pipeline components. In fact to transfer data coming from a Kinesis Stream to an S3 bucket, one needs a lambda to connect them. 

![Generic Lambda]({{site.baseurl}}https://github.com/kevllino/kevllino.github.io/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-05%20at%2013.01.53.png?raw=true)

The above defines a generic Lambda which will retrieve data triggered by a Kinesis Stream and post it into a Firehose which will deliver the data to the desired S3 bucket.

### Why Reactive?

To establish a reactive data pipeline, we took into account the  characteristics of a reactive system as defined by the [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/), i.e.:

- **Responsive**: latency of message processing and ability to quickly responds to failures. 
- **Resilient**: provides high availability, failure recovery 
- **Elastic**: scale up capacity when the limit capacity of these queues is reached. 
- **Message Driven**: as processes in the Lambda are triggered by event and work in a non-blocking style. 

## Serverless Framework 

- convenience 
- structure
